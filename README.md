## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The fastest way to spin up the full stack‚ÄîLiveKit agent worker, token API, RAG service, and frontend‚Äîis with Docker Compose.

1. Copy environment templates:
   ```bash
   cp services/livekit_agent/.env.example services/livekit_agent/.env
   cp services/rag_service/.env.example services/rag_service/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```
   Populate LiveKit, OpenAI, and Deepgram credentials, plus `VITE_LIVEKIT_WS_URL`, `VITE_BACKEND_URL`, and `VITE_RAG_SERVICE_URL`.

2. Launch everything:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   - FastAPI token API is exposed on port `8000`.
   - RAG service listens on `8081`.
   - Frontend is available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Visit the frontend, join a room, and converse with the agent. Compose handles dependent start order so the RAG service is ready before the agent connects.

To tear everything down: `docker compose down` (add `-v` to remove volumes if desired).

## Manual Development Workflow

Prefer running services individually? Start them in this order:

1. **RAG HTTP service**
   ```bash
   cd services/rag_service
   uv run rag-service
   ```
2. **FastAPI token API**
   ```bash
   cd services/livekit_agent
   uv run livekit-backend-api
   ```
   Configure host/port/CORS in `services/livekit_agent/.env`.
3. **LiveKit agent worker**
   ```bash
   cd services/livekit_agent
   uv run livekit-backend dev
   ```
4. **Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Layout

- `services/livekit_agent/` ‚Äî uv-managed Python app providing the agent worker (`livekit-backend`) and token API (`livekit-backend-api`).
- `services/rag_service/` ‚Äî FastAPI service offering `/query`, `/search`, and `/documents` endpoints backed by OpenAI vector stores.
- `packages/rag_core/` ‚Äî Shared retrieval utilities consumed by the agent and RAG service.
- `frontend/` ‚Äî Vite + React UI for joining rooms, rendering transcripts, and managing knowledge documents.
- `storage/documents/` ‚Äî Source PDFs synced into the OpenAI vector store.
- `.agent/` ‚Äî Living documentation (architecture, SOPs, and feature plans). Start with `.agent/README.md`.

---

## Environment Templates

- `services/livekit_agent/.env` ‚Äî LiveKit keys, RAG endpoint, LLM/STT/TTS model toggles.
- `services/rag_service/.env` ‚Äî OpenAI vector store configuration and HTTP server settings.
- `frontend/.env` ‚Äî Frontend URLs for LiveKit WebSocket, backend API, and RAG service.
- Root `.env.example` links to each service template for convenience.

## Contributing & Docs

1. Review `.agent/README.md` for the documentation index.
2. After modifying behaviour, update the relevant doc in `.agent/System`, `.agent/SOP`, or `.agent/Tasks`.
3. Keep `docker-compose.yml` and environment templates aligned with the docs to prevent drift.

Happy hacking! üéßüß†
